# Boat Rental Case

Once upon a time, not so long ago, there was a simple man, who hired out boats 
for pleasure trips. His name was Fred Bloggs and he had a small boat rental 
company on the shore of a big an beautiful lake. Everyday, came a lot of people 
to spend a nice time on Fred's small boats. 

When a customer came to make a trip, Fred would look out of the window to see 
if there was a boat available for the customer. Then, he took a blank card from 
his large drawer and noted the departure time. Afterwards, he placed the card 
in a small card-index box made by himself. Every partition of ths wooden box 
had a number, delighted painted by his beautiful daughter during the long 
winter evenings.

The number of the partition where the index-card was placed, was also written 
down on the ticket given to the customer.

One the sailing terminated, the customer returned back the ticket. Fred looked 
up for the corresponding card, wrote the arrival time and then computed the 
difference duration these times. The duration was used to compute the price the 
customer had to pay. These fars were also determined from a hourly tariff that 
depended on the workload and the weather.

In order to streamline his business, Fred decided that he needed an information 
system, so that he can get at every moment of the day the number of completed 
trips and their average duration. Furthermore, at the end of every sailing, he 
wanted to know the duration of the trip so that he could easily calculate the 
fare. 

Recently, Fred heard from one his customer that the object oriented approach is 
well suited for building felxible system. Therefor, he insists that you should 
use it too.
